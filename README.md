# Next Boilerplate Template

## Get started

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest <project-name> --example "https://github.com/sxpersxnic/Next-Boilerplate"

# or

git clone https://github.com/sxpersxnic/Next-Boilerplate.git
```

## Set up database

Run:

```sh
bun orm
```

This will ask which orm to setup (drizzle, prisma, supabase). Yes Supabase is not an orm but i just added it to orms to keep it simple.
